        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a former PeopleSoft developer and administrator taking the next step in my career.
        </p>
        <p>
          After earning my B.B.A. in Management Information Systems and working as a systems
          analyst for over a decade, I realized that I consistently enjoyed the coding side of my
          job far more than performing business analysis. This motivated me to pursue a
          post-baccalaureate B.Sc. in Computer Science to fill in the knowledge gaps left by my
          previous degree.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although my professional career has centered mostly on proprietary tools and frameworks,
          I also have extensive JavaScript experience and a knack for learning new technologies
          quickly. While earning my post-bacc degree, I've built class projects in a variety of
          languages and frameworks, including Node.js, TypeScript, React, C, and Python.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, I enjoy (slowly) remodeling my house, working out, gaming, and
          spending time with loved ones and a corgi named PB.
